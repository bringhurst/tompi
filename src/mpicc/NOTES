To do
 - wait for bug reports to appear

Incompatibilities
 - no statics are allowed in for loops
 - don't support variable with same name as type, and similarly don't support
   struct foo foo (which is supported in C but not C++ or is it?)
 - up to 511 characters for identifiers (with some lex's, that's really 199,
   but you should use flex anyway)
 - up to 65,535 characters for types, including some modifiers and the
   struct/union code in braces
 - up to 1023 characters for parens and brackets part of type (but not
   initializers) [per variable]
 - up to 50 levels of brace nesting
 - up to 100 variables declarared in each statement

Notes
 - volatile and const variables (not pointers to constants or volatiles) are
   not converted
 - .i files mean preprocessed C, just compile and assemble
