Here's a quick overview of this directory.  To compile/prepare the mentioned
programs (mpicc and g2tsd), type make.

MPICC
-----

mpicc is a shell script, like those in many MPI implementations, for compiling
C programs.  It automatically sets the include path (with -I) for the MPI
include files, and links in the MPI library when linking.  The major option is
accepts (other than those the C compiler accepts) is

        -profile: use the profiling version of the MPI library

If the extra output that mpicc generates causes problems, use the -quiet
option.  There are also some debugging options.

        -echo: display the commands that get executed
        -keep.i: keeps preprocessed C (.i) files (see below)

mpicc is especially important for TOMPI, because it runs the preprocessor
g2tsd.  g2tsd converts global declarations in your C programs to use
thread-specific data, which is necessary to provide the required semantics
(i.e., to "unshare" global variables between threads, which for TOMPI are MPI
processes).  The preprocessed output (which is rather large because it includes
all the included files) is stored temporarily in file.i for file.c, which you
can look at if you use the -keep.i option.

IMPORTANT NOTES
---------------

You shouldn't use global variables before calling MPI_Init(), but since that's
pretty much unavoidable, I'm supporting it best I can.  It should work on all
the currently supported systems.  Let me know if it breaks.

Some more (detailed, usually unimportant) notes are available in the NOTES file
in this directory.
