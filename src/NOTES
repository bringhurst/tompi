Support:

- 4.3, 4.4, 4.9.1, 4.9.5
- 5.3.1, 5.4.1
- 7.2-7.3

Future:

- environment variable/option for setting stack size and/or number of real
  processors would be nice (and easy!)

- support more collective communication
- efficient collective communication
- support attributes (including built-in ones), more on groups, more on
  communicators, user-defined datatypes, MPI_COMM_SELF
- mpirun script (follow MPI-2 standard)
- does mpicc follow MPI-2 standard?
- Fortran support

Possibilities:

- should store two different queues (although one mutex/cond perhaps), one
  for messages and one for replies?  necessary if I stop using request
  structures and put things right in the message, in which case the size
  of a reply is different.  and perhaps more efficient (and will need multiple
  queues for collective communication)

- should the strings in argv be copied for each thread?
- should check for more errors on thread calls (though it's getting better)

Bugs:

- RT threads seems really broken (at least with my instrumentation...): stack
  variables get mangled.  (proof: try fanpp with logger... times get messed up
  severely)
- mergesort doesn't work with RT threads... claims MPI_Init isn't called, i.e.
  MPII_Comm_world was called and the tsd stuff says it's null.  This may be
  related to the above problem.

Ideas:

- TOMPI console: command line option (-TOMPI?) or mpirun option (-console?)
    - can set default error handler to go to console (instead of exiting--
      useful for debugger), or could define ^C (SIGINT) to activate it
    - says what version of TOMPI you're running, in particular what thread
      system
    - say what TSD is used or if there's a Wtime extension (and what time it
      currently reports)
    - perhaps see what threads are still alive, and which are blocking
    - in some cases can interrupt a particular thread, or console takes over
      all threads... depends on system
    - basically generally useful commands for looking at your program (this is
      a development system after all)
    - I already have all the worlds...
